# cut_points
Algorithm of finding cut_point for UNi 

Main algorith cointaints in functions bfs and bfs_list. First is working with adjacency matrix, second with ddjacency list.

Data generates in functions Graph_gen.
In function matrix_to_list adjacency matrix converts to list. In the end of this function, matrix will be deleted to save memory.
